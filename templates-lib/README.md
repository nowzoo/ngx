## Contributing
Contributions and suggestions are welcome.

Get started...
```bash
git clone git@github.com:nowzoo/ngx.git
cd ngx
npm i
ng build NGXLIBNAME --prod
```

The library code is found in `projects/NGXLIBNAME`.

The demo site code is in `src/app/NGXLIBNAME`.

This library was built with the Angular CLI, so...

```bash
# test the library...
ng test NGXLIBNAME

# build the library...
ng build NGXLIBNAME --prod

# serve the demo site locally...
ng serve
```

Note that changes to the library code **are not** automatically reflected in the locally-served demo site. You must run `ng build NGXLIBNAME` whenever you make changes to the library. But the local server does watch for changes to the built library -- so you don't need to restart the server.

If you use [Wallaby](https://wallabyjs.com/) to run unit tests, select the `projects/NGXLIBNAME/wallaby.js` as your config file.
